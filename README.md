**Project Overview**
This project explores coffee quality data to identify key factors influencing cup scores and overall quality. Using SQL, and Power BI, the analysis provides insights into how attributes such as aroma, flavor, acidity, and processing methods affect coffee ratings.
The goal is to build a transparent, reproducible, and audit friendly workflow that can serve as both a portfolio project and a practical reference for data analysts working with food & beverage datasets
**Dataset**
•	Source: Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) dataset
•	Records: ~3,900 entries
•	Features: Country of origin, processing method, sensory attributes (aroma, flavor, acidity, body, balance, etc.), and cup score.
•	Format: CSV
 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
•	Distribution of cup scores across countries.
•	Correlation between sensory attributes and overall quality.
•	Identification of top performing regions and processing methods.
**Dashboarding**
•	Built recruiter ready Power BI dashboards.
•	Dynamic slicers for country, processing method, and score ranges.
•	Age grouping and hierarchies for interactive exploration.
**Insights****
•	Aroma and flavor show the strongest correlation with cup score.
•	Washed processing methods tend to yield higher quality ratings.
•	Certain regions consistently outperform others, highlighting terroir effects
